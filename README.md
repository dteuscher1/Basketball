This repository includes work done for the [Kobe Bryant Shot Selection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection) Kaggle competition. There was work done with fitting a model to determine whether or not Kobe would make a shot and there was EDA that was done to visualize the data in various ways. The EDA work and visualization was done by myself and is included in the `EDA.Rmd` and the write-up document is available as an HTML file, `EDA.html`. The HTML file would need to be downloaded to view the work that was done. 

The model fitting was done by [Matthew Morgan](https://github.com/mrmorgan17) and all credit is his. 

I can be contacted at david.teuscher.96@gmail.com if there are any questions and comments about the data visualization work that was done.
